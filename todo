Steps to follow for any NLP tasks -
- Load text file 
    - memory mapping for large files
    - read directly for normal files
    - Read text from file
        - from markup/ xml file
        - pdf / docx / txt

- Preprocessing
    - Translating characters from different language to English
    - Decode Unicode characters to normalised form (eg UTF8)
    - Handling of domain specific words, phrases or acronyms
    - Tokenise text 
    - Convert to lower text to make the text standardised (optional depending on the type of text)
    - Remove punctuation
    - Removing stopwords
    - Correcting typos
    - Stemming and Lemmatisation

- Vectorisation (Feature Extraction)
    - create an instance of the vectorizer (count, tf-idf, hashing)
    - use the preprocessing document or inbuilt parameters of the vectorizer class
    - fit the document so vectorizer can build the vocabulary
    - summarize by using vectorizer specific functions to better understand the document parsed
    - transform the document
    - summarize encoded vector
